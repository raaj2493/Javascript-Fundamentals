🧠 JavaScript Fundamentals

A personal repository documenting my journey of learning JavaScript — from basics to advanced concepts.
This repo includes notes, code examples, and practice exercises that help me strengthen my understanding step by step.

🚀 What You’ll Find Here

Core JavaScript concepts — variables, scopes, closures, prototypes, async/await, etc.

Hands-on examples and problem-solving practice.

Mini projects and experiments to apply concepts.

🧩 What I Plan to Learn Next

I’ll continue expanding my knowledge beyond JavaScript and explore the full backend ecosystem:

🐳 Docker — containerization, Dockerfiles, building images, running containers, orchestration basics

🔐 Authentication Systems — building login/signup flows, JWT, OAuth, session management, role-based access control

🍃 MongoDB — document modeling, CRUD operations, indexing, aggregation, and using it with Node.js (Mongoose)

🏗️ System Design — designing scalable systems, partitioning, caching, load balancing, and architectural trade-offs
