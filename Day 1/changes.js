/* 

In JavaScript, the const keyword is used to declare variables. Here are some key points about it:

 Purpose and Usage
 Immutable Binding: The primary purpose of const is to create a constant reference to a value. This means that once a variable is declared using const, its identifier cannot be reassigned to a new value.

  Declaration and Initialization: Variables declared with const must be initialized at the time of declaration. You cannot declare a const variable without assigning it a value. This is a common point of confusion for those new to JavaScript.
